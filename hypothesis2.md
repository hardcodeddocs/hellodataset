## Summary of Findings

### Statistical Analysis
1. **One-sample t-test**: The mean overall synergy score (4.28) was significantly higher than the neutral value of 3.0 (t = 34.12, p < 0.001), indicating strong perceived synergies from co-location.

2. **ANOVA**: Significant differences were found between stakeholder groups (F = 8.76, p < 0.001), with university faculty/staff and students reporting the highest synergy scores.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: A strong positive correlation (r = 0.83, p < 0.001) was found between perceived operational synergies and sustainability impact, suggesting that stronger synergies lead to greater sustainability.

4. **Multiple Regression**: Synergy factors collectively explained 76% of the variance in sustainability outcomes (R² = 0.76, p < 0.001), with training opportunities, shared facilities, and technical expertise being the strongest predictors.

5. **Chi-Square Test**: Significant associations were found between categorical responses (χ² = 42.53, p < 0.001), indicating consistent patterns across different demographic groups.

### Key Findings
1. All synergy factors received mean scores above 3.9 (on a 5-point scale), with practical training opportunities (4.76) and joint research opportunities (4.47) scoring highest.

2. Human resource development (4.67) and technology adoption (4.41) were identified as the sustainability outcomes most positively impacted by co-location.

3. University stakeholders (faculty, staff, and students) reported the highest synergy perceptions (4.56 and 4.52 respectively), while local business owners reported the lowest (3.87).

4. Strong correlations (all above 0.6) were found between most synergy factors and sustainability outcomes, with particularly strong relationships between:
   - Training opportunities and human resources development (r = 0.88)
   - Research opportunities and technology innovation (r = 0.85)
   - Shared facilities and infrastructure development (r = 0.82)
   - Operational efficiency and economic viability (r = 0.81)

5. Funding constraints (26.3%) and regulatory hurdles (20.0%) were identified as the most common challenges to achieving synergies.

6. Collaborative research programs (4.72) and industry-university partnerships (4.68) were rated as the most effective strategies for enhancing synergies.

### Conclusion
The analysis of the dummy data strongly supports the alternative hypothesis (H1) that co-location of BSMR Aviation University with Lalmonirhat Airfield creates significant operational synergies enhancing civil aviation sustainability. All statistical tests consistently rejected the null hypothesis (H0) at a high significance level (p < 0.001).

The data indicates that the co-location promotes knowledge exchange, practical training, research opportunities, and technological innovation, which collectively contribute to long-term sustainability through human resource development, infrastructure improvement, and economic viability. However, challenges related to funding, regulations, and coordination need to be addressed through strategic initiatives such as collaborative research programs and joint governance structures to fully realize these benefits
