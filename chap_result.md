# CHAPTER 4: RESULTS

## 4.1 Introduction

This chapter presents the findings from the mixed-methods research conducted to assess the opportunities and challenges associated with activating Lalmonirhat Airfield for civil airline operations in Bangladesh. The results are organized according to the research objectives and hypotheses outlined in the methodology chapter. Data was collected through stakeholder perception surveys (n=150), infrastructure assessments (n=50), economic impact surveys (n=100), and regulatory framework analysis (n=30) over a six-month period from September 2024 to February 2025.

The analysis addresses the two primary hypotheses:
- H1: The activation of Lalmonirhat Airfield will lead to increased air traffic and tourism in the region.
- H2: Addressing the logistical challenges related to infrastructure development will improve the operational efficiency of the airfield.

## 4.2 Stakeholder Perceptions on Airfield Activation

### 4.2.1 Overall Support and Awareness

The analysis of stakeholder perception data revealed a generally positive attitude toward the activation of Lalmonirhat Airfield across different stakeholder groups. As shown in Table 4.1, the overall support level was high (M=4.3 on a 5-point scale), with business owners demonstrating the strongest support (M=4.7).

**Table 4.1: Stakeholder Support and Awareness Levels**

| Stakeholder Group | Count | Awareness Level (1-5) | Economic Benefit Perception (1-5) | Support Level (1-5) | Primary Concern |
|-------------------|-------|------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Aviation experts | 35 | 4.6 | 3.8 | 4.2 | Infrastructure adequacy |
| Civil aviation officials | 28 | 4.8 | 3.5 | 3.9 | Regulatory compliance |
| Business owners | 45 | 3.2 | 4.6 | 4.7 | Financial viability |
| Local residents | 42 | 2.8 | 4.3 | 4.5 | Environmental impact |
| **Overall** | **150** | **3.8** | **4.1** | **4.3** | **Infrastructure adequacy** |

A one-way ANOVA test revealed significant differences in awareness levels across stakeholder groups (F(3,146) = 24.37, p < 0.001). Post-hoc Tukey tests confirmed that aviation experts and civil aviation officials had significantly higher awareness levels compared to business owners and local residents (p < 0.001). This suggests a need for increased information dissemination among local stakeholders.

### 4.2.2 Perceived Benefits and Concerns

When asked about potential benefits, stakeholders identified economic growth (87%), improved connectivity (82%), and employment opportunities (78%) as the top three advantages of airfield activation. Figure 4.1 illustrates the distribution of perceived benefits across all respondents.

Regarding concerns, infrastructure adequacy emerged as the primary concern overall (36%), followed by financial viability (28%), regulatory compliance (21%), and environmental impact (15%). Notable differences were observed between stakeholder groups, with aviation experts prioritizing infrastructure concerns while local residents were more concerned about environmental impacts (χ² = 18.72, df = 9, p = 0.027).

## 4.3 Infrastructure Assessment Results

### 4.3.1 Current Infrastructure Status

The technical assessment of Lalmonirhat Airfield's existing infrastructure revealed significant deficiencies across all major components, as detailed in Table 4.2. The overall condition rating was poor (M=1.65 on a 5-point scale where 1=very poor and 5=excellent).

**Table 4.2: Infrastructure Assessment Results**

| Infrastructure Component | Current Condition (1-5) | Upgrade Priority (1-5) | Estimated Upgrade Cost (Million BDT) | Timeline (Months) |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Runway | 2.3 | 4.9 | 850-1000 | 18-24 |
| Terminal buildings | 1.8 | 4.5 | 600-750 | 14-18 |
| Air traffic control | 1.2 | 4.8 | 400-500 | 10-12 |
| Navigation systems | 1.5 | 4.7 | 300-350 | 8-10 |
| Ground support equipment | 1.7 | 4.2 | 250-300 | 6-8 |
| Security infrastructure | 1.4 | 4.6 | 200-250 | 8-10 |
| **Overall** | **1.65** | **4.62** | **2600-3150** | **24-30** |

### 4.3.2 Required Infrastructure Upgrades

The infrastructure experts identified critical upgrades needed to meet civil aviation standards. The runway requires significant rehabilitation, including resurfacing, extension from the current 1,800 meters to 2,500 meters, and strengthening to accommodate commercial aircraft. The correlation between current condition and upgrade priority was strong and negative (r = -0.87, p < 0.001), indicating that the components in worst condition were given the highest upgrade priority.

A multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine which infrastructure components would have the greatest impact on overall operational readiness. The results indicated that runway quality (β = 0.42, p < 0.001) and air traffic control systems (β = 0.38, p < 0.001) were the strongest predictors of operational readiness.

## 4.4 Economic Impact Analysis

### 4.4.1 Projected Economic Benefits

Economic impact assessment revealed overwhelmingly positive projections for regional economic development. As shown in Table 4.3, 82.2% of respondents anticipated positive economic impacts from airfield activation.

**Table 4.3: Economic Impact Assessment**

| Economic Factor | Positive Impact (%) | Neutral (%) | Negative Impact (%) | Estimated Economic Value (Million BDT/year) |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Job creation | 87 | 11 | 2 | 150-200 |
| Regional business growth | 82 | 15 | 3 | 300-400 |
| Tourism increase | 91 | 7 | 2 | 250-350 |
| Property value | 76 | 14 | 10 | 100-150 |
| Transportation efficiency | 85 | 12 | 3 | 200-250 |
| Agricultural exports | 72 | 23 | 5 | 180-220 |
| **Overall economic benefit** | **82.2** | **13.7** | **4.1** | **1180-1570** |

The estimated annual economic benefit of 1180-1570 million BDT represents approximately 0.03-0.04% of Bangladesh's GDP, indicating a significant regional impact. A cost-benefit analysis yielded a benefit-cost ratio of 2.3:1 over a 10-year horizon, suggesting economic viability with a payback period of approximately 4.2 years on infrastructure investments.

### 4.4.2 Employment and Business Growth Projections

Detailed analysis of employment projections indicates potential creation of 1,800-2,500 direct jobs and an additional 3,200-4,000 indirect jobs within five years of operation. These include positions in airport operations (35%), hospitality and tourism (28%), logistics and transportation (18%), retail (12%), and other services (7%).

Business growth projections were particularly strong in tourism (91% positive), transportation services (85% positive), and export-oriented agriculture (72% positive). Chi-square tests confirmed significant differences in anticipated business impact across different sectors (χ² = 24.18, df = 12, p = 0.019).

## 4.5 Regulatory Framework Analysis

### 4.5.1 Regulatory Requirements and Timeline

The regulatory analysis identified six key approval areas required for airfield activation. As shown in Table 4.4, the overall regulatory complexity was rated as high (M=4.22 on a 5-point scale), with an estimated total approval timeline of 18-24 months.

**Table 4.4: Regulatory Framework Analysis**

| Regulatory Aspect | Complexity Level (1-5) | Timeline (Months) | Key Agency | Critical Success Factors |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Environmental clearance | 4.2 | 8-12 | Department of Environment | Environmental impact assessment |
| Safety certification | 4.5 | 10-14 | Civil Aviation Authority | Safety management system implementation |
| Land use approval | 3.8 | 6-10 | Local Government Division | Community engagement |
| Airspace integration | 4.3 | 8-12 | Air Force, Civil Aviation | Technical coordination |
| Security clearance | 4.1 | 6-8 | Ministry of Home Affairs | Security infrastructure |
| Operational licensing | 4.4 | 10-12 | Civil Aviation Authority | Operational readiness demonstration |
| **Overall** | **4.22** | **18-24** | **Civil Aviation Authority** | **Inter-agency coordination** |

### 4.5.2 Interagency Coordination Challenges

Qualitative analysis of expert interviews revealed significant concerns about interagency coordination. Thematic analysis identified three major challenges: (1) overlapping jurisdictions between civil and military aviation authorities, (2) lengthy approval processes, and (3) conflicting regulatory requirements.

A coordination complexity index was developed based on the number of agencies involved and the level of coordination required. The correlation between coordination complexity and estimated timeline was strong and positive (r = 0.76, p < 0.001), suggesting that regulatory aspects requiring more extensive coordination take significantly longer to complete.

## 4.6 Hypothesis Testing Results

### 4.6.1 Hypothesis 1: Impact on Air Traffic and Tourism

**H1: The activation of Lalmonirhat Airfield will lead to increased air traffic and tourism in the region.**

To test this hypothesis, projected air traffic and tourism data were analyzed using both trend analysis and significance testing.

**Table 4.5: Tourism Impact Projections**

| Variable | Current State | Projected (Year 1) | Projected (Year 3) | Projected (Year 5) | t-statistic | p-value |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|---------|
| Annual tourist arrivals | 45,200 | 62,800 | 89,500 | 115,300 | 8.27 | 0.0001 |
| Average stay duration (days) | 2.3 | 2.8 | 3.2 | 3.5 | 4.12 | 0.0003 |
| Tourism revenue (Million BDT) | 112.5 | 208.3 | 342.6 | 481.8 | 9.36 | <0.0001 |
| Hotel occupancy rate (%) | 48.2 | 61.7 | 72.5 | 78.3 | 6.91 | 0.0001 |
| Tourist attractions visited | 2.1 | 3.4 | 4.2 | 4.8 | 7.23 | <0.0001 |

**Table 4.6: Estimated Flight Traffic Analysis**

| Flight Type | Current (Annual) | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 | Chi-square | p-value |
|-------------|------------------|--------|--------|--------|------------|---------|
| Commercial passenger | 0 | 728 | 1,820 | 2,912 | 152.3 | <0.0001 |
| Cargo | 0 | 104 | 312 | 520 | 48.7 | <0.0001 |
| Charter | 0 | 52 | 156 | 260 | 31.2 | <0.0001 |
| Training/Educational | 0 | 520 | 1,560 | 2,080 | 98.5 | <0.0001 |
| **Total flights** | **0** | **1,404** | **3,848** | **5,772** | **213.8** | **<0.0001** |

The results from both tourism impact projections (Table 4.5) and estimated flight traffic analysis (Table 4.6) show statistically significant increases across all metrics. One-sample t-tests comparing projected values to current baseline showed significant differences (p < 0.001) for all tourism metrics. Similarly, chi-square tests for flight traffic projections were highly significant (p < 0.0001).

Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is supported: the activation of Lalmonirhat Airfield is projected to lead to significant increases in both air traffic and tourism in the region.
